# Build an augmented reality app on Root Insurance

## Hello!
We're excited to have you join this course, where you'll be building AR apps on [Root insurance](http://root.co.za/insurance/) along with a group of other keen developers!

The aim of Make Days is to explore and learn new things, and you don't need to achieve specific goals. The structure caters for varying levels of experience and different people will learn different things by playing with the same tools.
